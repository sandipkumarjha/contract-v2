  {
    q: "When does a deposit pay Stockback?",
    a: "When the deposit meets the published floor and you are under the lifetime cap. The allocator computes the exact figure before you confirm.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I buy a single stock without a basket?",
    a: "Yes. Use Markets to buy or sell tokenized stocks directly. Holdings appear in Portfolio under direct holdings.",

  {
    q: "What do I get after redeem?",
    a: "Your proportional basket value at current NAV, minus estimated external costs, in the original asset or underlying tokens.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why did a trade not appear?",
    a: "The indexer must be online. Start services with pnpm dev and ensure your wallet is connected.",

  {
    q: "How does the allocator work offline?",
    a: "The UI falls back to a local SDK estimate instantly, then replaces it when the allocator responds.",
