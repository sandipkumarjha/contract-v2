            Compose runs on <strong>Robinhood Chain</strong>, an Ethereum L2 where Robinhood issues tokenized US stocks as
            ERC-20 tokens. Compose gives those tokens two things they do not have on their own: a way to hold a{" "}
            <em>managed, diversified position</em> from a single deposit, and a way to <em>create new tradable assets</em>{" "}
            out of pairs of stocks.

            vault's NAV is read from chain. If every service were offline, deposits and redemptions would still work.
