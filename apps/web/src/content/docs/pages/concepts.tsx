            A pair creator can launch the pair&apos;s token on Pons v2 instead of the Compose curve. The token keeps the
            pair&apos;s name and symbol, but its market is a Pons bonding curve quoted in one of the pair&apos;s two stocks
            (or USDG). It is listed on ponsfamily.com from the launch block. The creator&apos;s share of the 1% curve fee
            (70%, plus any creator tax) accrues on the curve; the creator sweeps it into Pons&apos;s fee escrow and claims
            it from the token page. Only the creator&apos;s wallet can do either.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is one market, not two. Every Compose trade on such a token is routed onto the same Pons curve by{" "}
            <C>PonsRouter</C>, whether it is paid in ETH, USDG, the quote stock or the pair&apos;s shares. Compose shows the
            Pons price re-quoted in USD and in pair shares, so price and volume match on both sites by construction.
            Launching costs Pons&apos;s 0.0005 ETH launch fee; Pons taxes buys in the first three seconds after launch
            (99% decaying to zero), with the creator and up to 32 wallets the creator lists at launch exempt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like a launch made on Pons itself, the creator can set a creator tax when launching, from none up to
            Pons&apos;s cap (currently 10%). Pons charges it on every buy and sell on top of the 1% curve fee, in the quote
            asset, and credits it to the creator alongside their share of the curve fee. It is fixed at launch and cannot
            be changed afterwards. The token page shows it next to the fees so traders see the full cost before they
            trade.
