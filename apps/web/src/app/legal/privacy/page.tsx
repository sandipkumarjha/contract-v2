        <h3>Information you provide</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Wallet address.</strong> When you connect a wallet we receive its
            public address. We do not require your name, email address or phone number
            to use the core Services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Launchpad content.</strong> If you launch a pair, the display name,
            description, website link, banner and logo images you submit are stored and
            shown publicly alongside the pair.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Communications.</strong> If you contact us, we keep the content of
            your message and your contact details so we can respond.

        <h3>Information collected automatically</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Onchain activity.</strong> We index public blockchain data linked to
            your wallet, such as deposits, redemptions, swaps, receipt-token balances,
            pair launches, creator earnings and Stockback rewards, to show your portfolio,
            activity history and protocol analytics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Technical data.</strong> Our servers and infrastructure providers
            receive standard request data such as IP address, browser type, device
            information, pages requested and timestamps. We use it to operate, secure
            and debug the Services.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Information we do not collect</h3>
        <p>
          We do not collect private keys or seed phrases, and we will never ask for them.
          We do not currently use advertising trackers or third-party analytics cookies.
